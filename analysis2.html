          <h5>Methodology</h5>
          <br>
          <br>
          The goal of our project is to try to predict the personality type of individuals based on some text.<br>
          As our dataset has 2 columns: type of Myers-Briggs personality and the related post, we decided to try using classification methods such as Neural Network, Random Forests, SVM, KNN and Binomial Naïve Bayes.<br>
          <br><br>
          We first determined that it would be beneficial to extract key findings from our heavily texted data. We focused on capturing features such as number of words per post, the punctuation used as well as made use of a sentiment analysis to determine polarity and subjectivity in the text. Sentiment determines the ‘positivity’ or ‘negativity’ of a piece of writing. We used the TextBlob library to process the comments in our dataset and determine the sentiment for each row. Sentiment is rated from -1.0 to 1.0, where -1.0 is the most negative and 1.0 is most positive. 
          <br><br>
          We began generating our models and quickly realized that our data was severely balanced in personality type, also identifying that the 16 different categories was affecting our accuracy scores. We then decided to divide our personality types from 16 different categories into 2 categories. We wanted to focus on predicting whether a post was from an introverted personality or an extroverted personality.
          <br><br>
          We then tried calculating the accuracy for each category to compare if our model would be able to accurately predict if a post is Intuitive or Sensing, Feeling or Thinking, Judging or Perceiving. We later found out that the Neural Network model was best able to predict scores in all categories with the most accurate being in Intuition – Sensing and a close second being Introversion – Extroversion.
          <br><br>
          To increase the relevance to users, we decided to focus on Introversion – Extroversion to provide some meaningful and interesting predictions to users by using a text input from users and using the Neural Network model to determine if the user was more introverted or extroverted based on the text.
